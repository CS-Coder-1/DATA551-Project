# CODE OF CONDUCT

Adapted from the UWaterloo Sample Group Contract (https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/catalogs/tip-sheets/making-group-contracts)

## Group behaviours expected of each member:
Temporal
1.	All group members will be punctual. Meetings will start five minutes after the agreed start time and everyone should be there and ready by then.
2.	We should turn up to all meetings unless it has been agreed beforehand or unless there are unavoidable events such as illness.
3.	All group members will remain in the meeting until (a) all tasks for that meeting are completed, or (b) there is unanimous adjournment.
4.	Breaks will be decided by unanimous consent, and breaks will not exceed twenty minutes in length
________________________________________
## Procedural
1.	All group members will come to the meetings prepared by
(a) reading the assigned material (as much as possible), and
(b) coming with ideas pertaining to the tasks and decisions to be made.
2.	Tasks that group members agree to undertake should be completed to the agreed deadline. If it looks as though there will be a problem meeting a deadline, the person concerned should seek help from other members of the team in time to avoid a delay.
3.	There will be an assimilation period at the end of the session to evaluate group mechanics and ensure that all tasks have been completed adequately.
4.	Each group member has the right to point out whether any of these rules are being broken.
________________________________________
## Behavioural
1.	The group will actively seek a consensus of opinion based on the opinions of every member.
2.	Each member will take turns listening as well as talking, and active listening will be a strategy for all group discussions.
3. 	All team members are to be respectful and considerate of each other.
________________________________________
## Roles
1.	Roles will be assigned prior to a meeting or, if this is not possible, at the beginning of a meeting. Roles will rotate each meeting.
2.	The team will, at the beginning of a meeting, set sub-goals. These sub-goals will be presented to the group for a consensus of approval. The team is also responsible for the presentation of the group material to the rest of the class.

## Methods for resolving an impasse:
Step 1: The group members will isolate areas of disagreement, and the group will come to a consensus. If no consensus is reached, proceed to Step 2.
Step 2: The team will decide the relevance or importance of the dispute and may postpone the conflict if its relevance or importance is deemed questionable or minimal.
Step 3: The team will decide the amount of time for discussion or arbitration before calling a vote.
Step 4: The team will call a vote. If the vote is a stalemate, the team makes a final decision.
