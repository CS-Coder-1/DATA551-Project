The app features a landing page that gives an overview of the U.S. tech job market using a sidebar for filtering and four main plot panels. 

The sidebar on the left lets users easily filter the data by company size (using a slider), job title (through a search bar and checkboxes), and experience level (via checkboxes). 

The top panel displays a bar chart of the top 10 high paying jobs, which allows for efficient comparison of salaries across different job titles. 

In the middle section, the middle left panel shows a trendline of salaries per company size. This line chart visualizes the relationship between the size of a company and the average salary, helping users identify if they need to aim for a larger organization to get a higher paycheque. 

The middle right panel displays a job distribution map, which allows users to see which U.S. states have a higher concentration of available jobs in their chosen field(s). 

Finally, the bottom panel displays a boxplot of salary distribution by experience level. This gives detailed pay range information (minimum, median, and maximum) for different experience levels so users know what to expect depending on their background. 

All four charts are linked and update automatically as soon as the user changes any filter in the sidebar, making it simple to find the most relevant information for their job search.
